# UvA-IV2017-Team9


## Initial visualization for short presentation (Julius):
All done in Python 3. I am assuming that you have the basic ones (pandas, numpy, matplotlib)
python packages needed:
https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud (conda install -c https://conda.anaconda.org/amueller wordcloud)
https://github.com/vgm64/gmplot (pip install gmplot)
https://networkx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html (part of anaconda)

### The data file has to be named "Terror_data.csv" and has to be one directory up. kinda shitty but github doesnt like files larger than 100mb.
